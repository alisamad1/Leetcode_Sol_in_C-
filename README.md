# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions in C++

Welcome to my collection of **LeetCode problem solutions written in C++**, organized simply by **question number** for quick access and clarity.

This repository is my personal archive to track progress, revise daily, and help others who are practicing for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## 👨‍💻 About the Repository

- 🟦 Solutions are named using the **LeetCode problem number**, like `1.cpp`, `42.cpp`, etc.
- 🔢 Covers a wide range of topics including arrays, linked lists, trees, DP, backtracking, and more.
- ⏱ Most questions are solved using optimal or near-optimal time/space complexity.
- 📘 Written using clean, readable, and beginner-friendly C++ code.

## 📌 Sample File Naming

Here’s how solutions are named:

1. LC_1.cpp //Two Sum
2. LC_2.cpp //Add Two Numbers


> You can search the LeetCode website using the question number to match it with the solution.
